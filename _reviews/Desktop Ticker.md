Desktop tickets all generaly do the same thing; they take an RSS feed and scroll the artical titles across the bottom or top of the screen. Most of these will run into overlay issued which this tool nicely solves with its docking capability. When docked you will not need to worry about full screen applications being partially hidden under the ticker. This is expecially helpful if your planning to run this on an employee information screen with everything full screened.
