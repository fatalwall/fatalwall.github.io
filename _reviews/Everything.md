Everything has become a must have on all of my systems. Over the years I have turned more and more to electronic documents and although I do my best to organize them in a logical method it is fairly common for me to forget where I haved that one ciritcal file from 4 years ago that I only have 2-5 minutes to track down before a meeting that was sent to me after the meeting has already begun.

Although windows has had search built in for years built on top of a powerful indexing engine the front end has always been dreadfully slow and rarely bringing the files your looking for to the top. Since starting to use it two years ago based on a colleges recomendation I have not looked back. Its simple, effective, and a life savor is the ever growing "more with less" IT culture.
